# Javascript-eCommerce-Module
A javascript module to handle the products/services that appears on each page. So basically insteaded of setting some HTML-Markups and running a foreach loop to display all of your products/services, you will simply pass this module an array of objects that you fetched from the database and bind it to a specific DOM Element. Do note that it wont work if javascript is not activated on the user browser so under rare circumstancesit as the one Ive just mentioned it wont work.
